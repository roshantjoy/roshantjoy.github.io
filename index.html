                <P class="p">While I was working on my content,first I thought I should use Covid Fighters/workers instead.Soon I realised "WARRIERS" is the most appropriate word for our doctors and governments,like the brave souls who fought in Sparta-Athens war and in Mahabharatha.And we all know that these great warriers ("our muthumanees") are going through do or die situation ,only to redeem us from a pandemic,so alien and powerful. </P>
                <p class="p">So lets check out how the resposibilities are shared between people who are in fight against novel corona virus</p>

             <div class="col-md-8 ">
                 <p class="p">If this fight against corona were an avengers end game war,Health services would have been the Captian Marvel(No fan fights intended).That much significant and crucial role is played by them.Every workers from doctors to toilet cleaners in hospital deserve Respect.Most hilarius thing is that they are one more succeptible to infection.To prevent that they are forced to wear PPE(personal protection equipment).But just imagine my fellas,how much uncomfartable it will be,if we are to attend an afternoon class with no fans,let alone doctors with PPE in summar holidays. </p>
                 <p class="p">And dont forget about the nurses ,wingless angels as we call them,who can do nothing ,but love their patients.While we are enjoying our good time with our family,they after their duty is forced to be with their isolation in quarantine.How painful?  </p>
                 <p class="p">So<strong>Thank You </strong> for risking your own life to save others</p>

                <p class="p">"Whatever it may be without proper coordination or planning,it will all end up in vail".A cliche phrase acquainted to those who have attended life skills.Now this facet is realised by our governments.Though different governments differ in execution of their covid plans,in general all governments give their citizens,hope and an assurance that they are not by themselves.In particular in kerela,present government was able to contain community spread,by enacting laws for lockdown and use of masks in public.Government could also successfully quarentine emigrants from foreign countries as well as from states within India </p>
                <p class="p">Our government keep on expressing their sincere intrest in helping poor and needy,through their policies and incentives.</p>
                <p class="p">So <strong>Thank You</strong> for leading all of us in difficult time.</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
                <p class="p">From the beginning of lockdown and to until now,police always was there to help.A BIG SALUTE!!!! can never fill the gratitude we owe for them.Like others they also have toiled.From executing curfew to quarentining patients ,police was the must-wanted.Without any distinction,all police officers starting from DGP to constables came out to public,to give awarness,while performing lockdown. There public got to know the virtuous face of police.All must have seen a video of police officer begging the travelers to follow lockdown ,in tears </p>
                <p class="p">These all must have influenced our younger ones to want for police uniform.</p>
                <p class="p">So <strong>Thank You</strong> for your brave and sincere works</p>

            <div class="col-md-8">
               <p class="p">In a different perspective social media is as important as health services.It's the onlt medium through which information is reached on public.To know everything regarding COVID-19 and the strategies deployed by government against it ,plays important role in prevention against the virus.And it is highly noteworthy to mention journelists ,who risks their on life to collect everything related to this pandemic and to distribute it in public. </p>
               <p class="p">Since social media is highly prone to explosion of fake news,care must be taken before devouring everything</p>
               <p class="p">So <strong>Thank You</strong> for always alerting us. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-8">
               <p class="p">Last but not the least,The people.Governments and doctors can only give precautions.But it is upto us ,eithet to follow or to deny them.Any covid patient if he wish to spread his infection has the power to destroy our entire land.(I dont know why? he might be a joker).So guys it is not he/she fighting .It is US</p>
               <p class="p"> So far people in kerela showed honesty in abiding rules and regulations.That's why we have lowest mortality rate in India and K K Shailaja was featured in Vogue. </p>
               <p class="p">So <strong>Thank You</strong> for being really matured</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
 <div class="final text-center" id="Conclusion">
    <p class="p">There are still others to mention in this fight.Researchers who are working on vaccines holds the future.The search for that elixir is in ever increasing rate.Researches are also being held in India.Only recently an Indian pharmacist died on testing vaccine on himself.I think such guys are the true <strong>WARRIERS</strong>  of our fight,worth to be manufactured as toys in large scale.</p>
    <p class="p">This period is also of great oppurtunities.Along with COVID ,we also have houres of free time.Try to develop your skills.Try participating in online competitions like Proxecto,web designing competition ; ) Let you be amused of yourself after the lockdown.Wish you dont die before lockdown(just kidding) and let you be there when corona sings </p>
    <p class="p">"Njaanum oru varna pattamaayirunnu"(again kidding)</p>
    <p>Warriers,</p>
    <p class="p"><strong class="thank">THANK YOU</strong> </p><span>(pa papaaa.. 20th century Fox theme bgm playing)</span>
